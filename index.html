    <h1> I Wish for the Rain by Liana Flores</h1>

    <p>
  Walk in the rain with nobody there <br>
But a simple refrain, a chill in the air <br>
And a moon hanging pale <br>
Casting shadows over the cobblestone street <br>
At morning when the air is new, your presence lingers on <br>
Tears upon the pillow where you lay <br>
My coffee's getting colder while I wonder where you've gone <br>
Better off alone than be <br>
A fool in the rain, hoping you'll come by <br>
But you won't, I'll remain with tears in my eyes <br>
I'm a living clich√©, and you're kissing her face <br>
I'm alone<br>
      With a wish for the rain<br>
When I cry, the rain knows why<br>
She knows<br>
