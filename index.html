    <h1> Love Comes Easy By Thee Sacred Souls</h1>

    <p>
<strong> Every hour spent with you feels like flying</strong><br>
And every once in a while I forget to breathe<br>
'Cause love with you, it comes easy <em> (easy, easy, easy, easy, ooh)</em><br>
Easy to me like walking <em>(easy, easy, easy, easy)</em> ooh<br>
'Cause love with you, it comes easy, baby<br>
Ooh, with you<br>
Every single kiss from you feels like heaven<br>
And every once in a while I forget to breathe<br>
'Cause love with you, it comes easy <em>(easy, easy, easy, easy, ooh)</em><br>
Yes, it does<br>
Easy to me like walking<em> (easy, easy, easy, easy, ooh)</em><br>
So, love with you, it comes easy, baby<br>
Ooh, with me<br>
Hold up baby, can't you see?<br>
Just like walking, love with you comes easily<br>
<strong>'Cause you want me for me</strong><br>
